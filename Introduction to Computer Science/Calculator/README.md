# Binary tree

**Algorithms: Binary tree and stack**

A calculator for arithmetic expressions. The arithmetic expressions to be evaluated may contain operations of addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, power, radiation, exponent and logarithm represented by the symbols +, -, *, /, **,
sqrt (), exp () and log () respectively.

## Input

* Lines followed by standard operator priority (for mounting the binary tree)
* Sequence of arithmetic expressions

### Example
```
**
/
*
-
+

1+2*3,
5/(2-2),
sqrt[log{10+2*3],
log{2**(5+21/7)}+exp[3];
```
## Output

* The result or a message of invalid expression, in respective lines

### Example
