# HEAVY WORK

Probably the hardest project by now, this discipline is a oppening of database concepts. Here we work with really low-level coding, 
manipulating a big binary and .csv registry sheet file, where are needed to convert all the sheet into a binary database, with additional
commands like register, remove, update, merge, and obviously seek for some cadastre.

This is the final result of one semester.
